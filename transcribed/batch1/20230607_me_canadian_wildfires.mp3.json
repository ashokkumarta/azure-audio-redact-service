associate professor in the department of environmental health and engineering at johns hopkins university good morning professor good morning so so what is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many people so far away well there's a couple of things the the season has been pretty dry already and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those canadian wildfires through pennsylvania into the mid atlantic in the northeast and and kind of just dropping the smoke there so what is it in this haze that makes it it harmful and i'm assuming it is harmful it is it is the the levels outside right now in baltimore are considered unhealthy and and most of that is due to what's called particulate matter which are tiny particles microscopic smaller than the width of of your hair that can get into your lungs and and impact your respiratory system your cardiovascular system and even your your neurological your brain what what makes this particularly harmful is it the the volume of particulant is it something in particular you know what is it exactly can you just drill down on that a little bit more yeah so the concentration of particulate matter i was looking at some of the monitors that we have was was reaching levels of what are in in science peak a hundred and fifty micrograms per meter cubed which is more than ten times what the annual average should be and about four times higher than what you're supposed to have on a twenty four hour average and so the concentrations of these particles in the air are just much much much higher than we typically see and exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health problems and who is most vulnerable i noticed that in new york city for example they're canceling outdoor activities and so here it is in the you know early days of summer and they have to keep all the kids inside so who tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this it's the the youngest so children obviously whose bodies are still developing the elderly who are you know their bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of of breathing the the poor air quality and then people who have pre existing health conditions people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions can be triggered by high levels of air pollution could this get worse that's a good question i mean i think if and in some areas it's it's much worse than others and it's it just depends on kind of where the smoke is concentrated i think new york has some of the higher concentrations right now but that's going to change as that air moves away from the new york area but over the course of the next few days we will see different areas being hit at at different times with with the highest concentrations i was going to ask even more fire start burning i don't expect concentrations to go up too much higher i was going to ask you how and you started answer this but how much longer could this last or forgive me if i'm asking you to speculate but what what do you think well i think the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer but the key for us in the US is the weather system changing and so right now it's it's kind of the weather systems that are pulling that air into our into our mid atlantic and and northeast region as those weather system change systems change and shift we'll we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not impact us in this region as much and so i think that's going to be the defining factor and i think the next couple days we're going to see see a shift in that in that weather pattern and and start to push the smoke away from from where we are

We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter de Carlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, Professor. Good morning. So, So what is it about the conditions right now that have caused this round of wildfires to affect so many people so far away? Well, there's a couple of things. The, the season has been pretty dry already. And then the fact that we're getting hit in the US is because there's a couple weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the Mid-Atlantic in the Northeast and and kind of just dropping the smoke there.

And and most of that is due to what's called particulate matter which are tiny particles microscopic smaller than the width of of your hair that can get into your lungs and and impact your respiratory system, your cardiovascular system and even your your neurological, your brain. What what makes this particularly harmful? Is it the, the volume of particulant is it something in particular, You know what is it exactly? Can you just drill down on that a little bit more? Yeah. So the concentration of particulate matter, I was looking at some of the monitors that we have was was reaching levels of what are in, in science peak 150 micrograms per meter cubed, which is more than 10 times what the annual average should be and about four times higher than what you're supposed to have on a 24 hour average. And so the concentrations of these particles in the air are just much, much, much higher than we typically see. And exposure to those high levels can lead to a host of health problems. And who is most vulnerable. I noticed that in New York City, for example, they're canceling outdoor activities. And so here it is in the, you know, early days of summer and they have to keep all the kids inside. So who tends to be vulnerable in a situation like this? It's the the youngest. So children obviously whose bodies are still developing, the elderly who are, you know, their bodies are more in decline and they're more susceptible to the health impacts of of breathing the the poor air quality. And then people who have pre-existing health conditions, people with respiratory conditions or heart conditions can be triggered by high levels of air pollution. Could this get worse? That's a good question. I mean I think if and in some areas it's it's much worse than others and it's it just depends on kind of where the smoke is concentrated. I think New York has some of the higher concentrations right now, but that's going to change as that air moves away from the New York area. But over the course of the next few days we will see different areas being hit at at different times with with the highest concentrations. I was going to ask even more fire start burning. I don't expect concentrations to go up too much higher. I was going to ask you how and you started answer this, but how much longer could this last or forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate, but what what do you think? Well, I think the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer, but the key for us in the US is the weather system changing. And so right now it's it's kind of the weather systems that are pulling that air into our into our Mid-Atlantic and and Northeast region. As those weather system change systems change and shift we'll we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not impact us in this region as much. And so I think that's going to be the defining factor and I think the next couple days we're going to see see a shift in that in that weather pattern and and start to push the smoke away from from where we are. And finally with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide-ranging air, air quality consequences or or circumstances? I mean that is one of the predictions for for climate change looking into the future. The fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer and we're seeing more frequent fires. So yeah, this is probably something that we'll be seeing more frequently. This tends to be much more of an issue in the Western US so. So the Eastern US getting hit right now is, is a little bit new. But yeah, I think with climate change moving forward, this is something that's is going to happen more frequently.

But over the course of the next few days we will see different areas being hit at at different times with with the highest concentrations. I was going to ask even more fire start burning. I don't expect concentrations to go up too much higher. I was going to ask you how and you started answer this, but how much longer could this last or forgive me if I'm asking you to speculate, but what what do you think? Well, I think the fires are going to burn for a little bit longer, but the key for us in the US is the weather system changing. And so right now it's it's kind of the weather systems that are pulling that air into our into our Mid-Atlantic and and Northeast region. As those weather system change systems change and shift we'll we'll see that smoke going elsewhere and not impact us in this region as much. And so I think that's going to be the defining factor and I think the next couple days we're going to see see a shift in that in that weather pattern and and start to push the smoke away from from where we are. And finally with the impacts of climate change, we are seeing more wildfires. Will we be seeing more of these kinds of wide-ranging air, air quality consequences or or circumstances? I mean that is one of the predictions for for climate change looking into the future. The fire season is starting earlier and lasting longer and we're seeing more frequent fires. So yeah, this is probably something that we'll be seeing more frequently. This tends to be much more of an issue in the Western US so. So the Eastern US getting hit right now is, is a little bit new. But yeah, I think with climate change moving forward, this is something that's is going to happen more frequently.

Professor Decarlo, thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with us.
